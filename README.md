## Background  

This project investigates **structural variants (SVs)** and **copy number variations (CNVs)** in CNS tumor genomes using Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing.  

Two workflows were compared:  
- **ROBIN** → baseline pipeline (methylation classification, SV & CNV calling)  
- **BATMAN** → extended pipeline (adaptive sampling with real-time breakpoint enrichment)  

This study aims to investigate structural variants (SVs) (Hurles et al. 2008) in central nervous system (CNS) tumors using long read nanopore sequencing, and to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of two analytical pipelines, ROBIN(Deacon et al. 2025) and BATMAN, in detecting these variants.

## Input Data – Obtaining BAM files  

- Basecalled Nanopore reads were processed through the **ROBIN** and **BATMAN** workflows.  
- Final **BAM files** for each sample were used as input for downstream SV calling.  
- These BAMs are **not hosted** here due to size restrictions, but all subsequent scripts assume you start from a sorted BAM.

## Reference Genome Preparation  

We used **GRCh38.p14** from Ensembl as the reference genome.  

```bash
# Download reference genome from Ensembl
wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-114/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz

# Unzip
gunzip Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz

# Index reference for samtools
samtools faidx Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa
Structural Variant Detection
Three SV callers were used: Sniffles2, cuteSV, and SVIM.

Each was installed and run in its own conda environment.

Install environments
# Create environment
conda create -n sv-callers -y
conda activate sv-callers

# Install tools
conda install -c bioconda sniffles=2.0
conda install -c bioconda cutesv
conda install -c bioconda svim
Run commands
# Sniffles2
sniffles --input sample.bam --vcf sniffles.vcf --minsupport 5 --output-rnames

# cuteSV
cuteSV sample.bam Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa cutesv.vcf ./cutesv_output

# SVIM
svim alignment svim_out/ sample.bam Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa
Merging and Filtering of SVs
We merged VCF outputs from the three callers using SURVIVOR, requiring at least 2 callers to support an event and a maximum distance of 500 bp.

Install SURVIVOR
conda install -c bioconda survivor
Run command
# input_files.txt contains the VCFs (sniffles.vcf, cutesv.vcf, svim.vcf)
SURVIVOR merge input_files.txt 500 2 1 1 0 30 merged.vcf
Variant Filtering and Prioritization
To reduce false positives and focus on biologically meaningful events:

Variants with QUAL > 40 were kept.

For each SV type (DEL, DUP, INV, TRA), the top 10 events by size were retained.

This filtering was performed downstream in R/Python scripts (provided separately).

## Visualization and Validation
Variants were validated using multiple visualization tools.

IGV
Manual inspection of BAM alignments for:

Deletions → drop in coverage + split reads

Duplications → spike in coverage

Inversions → inward/outward facing reads

Translocations → split reads mapping to other chromosomes

Prepare files for IGV:
samtools index sample.bam
bcftools index merged.vcf
Samplot
conda install -c bioconda samplot
samplot plot -n SAMPLE -b sample.bam -c chr3 -s 75376331 -e 75591822 -t DEL -o sv.png
Ribbon
Upload BAM files to Ribbon for read-level visualization of complex events.

Circos-style Plots
Python scripts included here were used for genome-wide SV mapping:
# BATMAN Circos plot
python BATMAN/make_circos_batman.py --csv BATMAN/example_batman_sv.csv --out_prefix results/chromosomal_map_BATMAN

# ROBIN Circos plot
python ROBIN/make_circos_robin_blank.py --out_prefix results/chromosomal_map_ROBIN
Comparison of Variant Callers
We compared Sniffles2, cuteSV, and SVIM:

Venn diagrams generated in R (eulerr package) to show overlaps.

Concordance evaluated at merged events (SURVIVOR).

ROBIN vs BATMAN outputs were compared to highlight the effect of adaptive sampling.

## Annotation
To interpret the biological relevance, SVs were annotated against cancer gene databases.

Install bedtools
conda install -c bioconda bedtools
Run annotation
bedtools intersect -a merged.vcf -b COSMIC_CGCv96.bed -wa -wb > SVs_with_genes.tsv
R-based annotation
biomaRt for gene annotation

VariantAnnotation for VCF parsing

ggplot2/dplyr for visualization

## Data Availability
Scripts and summary tables are available in this repository.

BAM/VCF files are too large and not uploaded, but are stored on Ada HPC and available upon request.
